Hi, I'm Sabrina — a senior CS/ Math student at Penn State with a deep interest in machine learning, data science, and applied math.  

This blog is where I share:
- Explorations in code and math 
- Projects I’m working on 
- My birding + travel stories

When I’m not coding, I’m probably birding, spending time with my friends, or cooking.
