{{< aboutintro src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Sabri’s Photo" >}}
Hi—I’m **Sabrina Adler**, a senior CS/Math student at Penn State with a deep interest in machine learning, data science, and applied math. 
{{< /aboutintro >}}

This blog is where I share:

- Explorations in code and math  
- Projects I’m working on  
- My birding + travel stories  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably birding, hanging out with friends, or cooking.
